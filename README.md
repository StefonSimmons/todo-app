# Will-Do app

## About
Write down what you want to do and then do it with this user-Friendly app for productivity. 

Originally, the app was a part of a React.js code along session I did for my software engineering students. I turned it into a fullstack app with account authentication.


## Tech
1. React.js: front-end component-based javascript library.
1. Express.js: back-end Node.js framework for handling my account authentication-feature.
1. Airtable: back-end spreadsheet-database hybrid for storing user and to-do records.
1. Axios: Node.js libary that faciliates HTTP requests to airtable and my express app routes from the browser.
1. BCrypt: Node.js libary for hashing passwords. Included "salt rounds" to protect against rainbow table attacks
1. JSON Web Token (jwt): Node.js libary for encoding and decoding a payload/claim with a secret key with the purpose of authorizing persistant access to user account data on a given browser session.
